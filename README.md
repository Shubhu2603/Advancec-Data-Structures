# C++ and Java Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in C++ and Java. The code includes implementations of various tree structures, sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, and file handling techniques.

## Files

### C++ Implementations

1. **Binary_Search_Tree.cpp**
   - Implementation of a binary search tree with basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

2. **Dictionary_using_Binary_Search_Tree.cpp**
   - Implementation of a dictionary using a binary search tree, supporting operations like lookup, insertion, and deletion.

3. **Dictionary_using_Hashing(Linked list).cpp**
   - Implementation of a dictionary using hashing with separate chaining (linked lists) to handle collisions.

4. **Expression_Tree.cpp**
   - Implementation of an expression tree to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions.

5. **File_handling_in_C++.cpp**
   - Demonstrates file handling in C++, including reading from and writing to files.

6. **Graph.cpp**
   - Implementation of basic graph operations, including creation, traversal (BFS and DFS), and possibly pathfinding algorithms.

7. **Heap_Sort.cpp**
   - Implementation of the heap sort algorithm for sorting an array of integers.

8. **Shell_Sort.cpp**
   - Implementation of the shell sort algorithm, an efficient in-place comparison sort.

9. **Telephone_Directory_using_Hashing(Linked List).cpp**
   - Implementation of a telephone directory using hashing with separate chaining to manage collisions.

10. **Threaded_binary_Tree.cpp**
    - Implementation of a threaded binary tree, a variant of binary trees that makes in-order traversal faster and does not require a stack or recursion.

### Java Implementations

1. **Insertion.java**
   - Implementation of the insertion sort algorithm in Java.

2. **Shell_Sort.java**
   - Implementation of the shell sort algorithm in Java.
